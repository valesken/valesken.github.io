<p>A long while back, long before we started on this trip, we decided that planning an entire year of travel was
unreasonable. Especially given the ever-changing COVID restrictions, there were simply too many variables to anticipate.
Weather could change unexpectedly; geopolitical conflict could suddenly ignite; someplace else just seems more
interesting. So we settled on a simple strategy. We would pick a few things that we knew we wanted to do and then fill
in the gaps as we went along.</p>
<p>As our time in Greece drew to a close, we found ourselves on the brink of one of those gaps. This one had some
particular constraints. First, in mid-June we would head to India. This meant that we didn't want to go too far afield
to avoid paying an expensive plane ticket to India. Second, later in the summer and fall, we would be spending time in
Europe. This meant that we needed to be careful about spending too much time in the Schengan area, because visa
restrictions meant that we only have 90 days of time in Schengan area countries available to us. Third, it happens to
be the start of the rainy season over a large swath of Asia.</p>
<p>One day, Alexa was looking at a list of multi-day hikes and came across one in Scotland that made both of us stop and
dream: the West Highland Way.</p>
<p>It's a 96-mile hike starting just a little north of Glasgow, and ending in the town of Fort William. Along the way are
incredible views of Scottish lochs, rolling hills, and quaints towns and villages. It is truly the highlands. As the Way
passes through a little over a dozen towns, our days on the trail can start and end in a town with a bed and a
meal. This significantly cuts down on the amount of gear required, which is important given we are not traveling with
any camping equipment.</p>
<p>We haven't hit the trail yet, but we will soon, in early June. So, we get to explore the UK!</p>
<h2>In the Meantime...</h2>
<p>So we had an idea. We booked nights in towns along the trail and settled that one week. But that still left about four
weeks unaccounted for. What to do?</p>
<p>Turns out, there's quite a lot to do. A few people, notably Alexa's sister, suggested that the Greenwich Observatory was
the place to be, so we hopped on a train and made our way to Greenwich. It was a very short ride from where we were
staying in London and gave us immediate envy for Britain's public transportation. I mean seriously, it's amazing. You
can get nearly anywhere by train and it doesn't take an unreasonable amount of time or money to do so. And for that last
mile from the train station to wherever you're staying, you can bet there's a bus that will get you there. Come on,
America, you can do better.</p>
<p>At any rate, we made it to Greenwich. The observatory is a set of two smallish brick buildings on a low hill overlooking
London. It's a remarkable view. In the foreground, bordered by the river Thames, is a wide open green space and the
colonnaded Queen's House. In the background sprawls the City of London, St. Paul's Cathedral looming large. It's an
interesting point of connection to the Observatory, for both were originally designed and built by Christopher Wren.</p>
<p>There's a lot ot learn at the Greenwich Observatory and I won't bore you by reciting it all here. But I will say that it
was very cool to stand on the Prime Meridian and learn about why the Prime Meridian even exists. There's a wikipedia
article that explains it in much more depth than I am willing to do, but the basic problem which Greenwich Observatory
was meant to solve was that navigators out at sea had no reliable way to determine what longitude they were at, which
was resulting in a lot of shipwrecks.</p>
<p>In order to do so, you need a fixed reference point, a line which represents your starting point, your 0th degree. And
you also need to know what time it is at that reference line. The observatory thus arbitrarily created a 0th degree line
called the Prime Meridian and began to create a book mapping the positions of the stars to times at Greenwich. When the
work was complete, a navigator could look at the stars and, by referencing the book, determine what time it was at
Greenwich. They could then determine what time it was at their current location by various other means and deduce their
longitude based on the difference between those times. As it so happens, this is also the origin of time zones.</p>
<h2>For Queen and Pasty</h2>
<p>With a few days available to us until our next stop, we decided to explore the southwest of England a bit. So once again
we hopped on a train and made our way out of London. Our next stop: St Ives in Cornwall.</p>
<p>St Ives is a very pretty beach town nearly at the southwestern tip of the country. Its famous sunsets inspired
generations of artists to visit or live there and work. In particular, it's the home of a number of accomplished Modern
Artists, and it has a very nice, if small, museum dedicated to them.</p>
<p>Alexa found us a very cool glamping hut a short walk out of town atop a wide hill. From there, we had spectacular views
every morning of the wide open sea before us. A five-minute walk away brought us to a tall stone plinth, a monument of
some sort with even more incredible views. From here you could see a long stretch of coastline on the one side,
including St Ives and a couple other coastal towns, and sprawling pastoral farmland on the other side. We made our way
up there for sunset on our first night and immediately understood why this place is so special. Golden light bathed the
world and dramatic shadows played across the land. The wind whipped fiercely around the corners of the monument, putting
our Greece-softened tolerance of the cold to the test, but we stuck it out and watched the final moments of the sun
lowering itself below the horizon.</p>
<p>The next day, we gorged ourselves on sea views and Cornish pasties. We ate and walked and looked about. We sat on a
beach and did our best to paint the scene with some watercolors we picked up in Greece. At the end of the day, we
climbed a hill at the end of the town to an old stone building by a lighthouse and watched some local performers play
their music. It was a lovely way to spend a day.</p>
<h2>On Big Stones and Hot Water</h2>
<p>It was time to get on the train again. We watched the countryside roll by again, St Ives Bay giving way to open fields
and hedge rows, slate-roofed houses and sheep. It took 5 hours, 3 trains, and a half hour of walking up hills, but we
made it to the city of Bath. I'd heard from several friends that this was a city worth visiting and, as it was somewhat
near to Stonehenge, we thought maybe it would be a good base for a day trip.</p>
<p>Our host was a friendly older couple who had traveled through America, staying at Airbnbs, and became inspired to be
hosts themselves. One thing that has stood out to me is that in the UK, in contrast to the US, the Airbnb hosts we've
had have been far more interested in being good hosts than in running some sort of commercial operation. They've all
been friendly and kept the relationship personal. As one of our hosts, John, showed us to our room, he very happily
chatted with us about how he loves having guests and showing them around Bath. It's a warmth that I've come to really
appreciate.</p>
<p>John had some recommendations for us too. First, multiple visitors had told him that visiting the Roman Baths was
absolutely worth it. Second, his visitors had generally been more impressed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avebury">Avebury</a> than by Stonehenge, but he would help us find a way to visit Stonehenge
(apparently, the previous bus route to Stonehenge had disappeared).</p>
<p>Naturally, we started our first day in Bath by spending our morning at <a href="https://www.thermaebathspa.com/">the spa</a>. We
may be trying to travel cheap, but this felt like a luxury not worth passing up. And indeed, it was very nice. There
were multiple steam rooms, a sauna, a heated indoor pool, and a heated rooftop pool with views of the city. (By &quot;heated&quot;
I mean naturally, geothermally heated.) We floated, we sweat, we luxuriated. It was wonderful.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we visited the Roman Baths. I won't dive into all the detail here as it would take too long, but I
agree with our hosts' previous visitors - it was worth it. We spent a couple hours there reading all the signs that we
could handle reading, and left only because we were quickly running out of time before I had to be back for a meeting.
One cool factoid that I hadn't realized: the people living in the area before the Romans arrived already had fairly
advanced societies that were conducting trade with mainland europe via boats. It feels obvious in retrospect, but my
view of those peoples was so clearly inaccurate and it surprised me.</p>
<p>The next day, we went to Avebury. After a great deal of consideration, we passed on Stonehenge. Will we regret it later?
I hope not and I think not. Points in Avebury's favor:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is the largest megalithic circle in the world and has the largest henge stone in the world.</li>
<li>The site pre-dates Stonehenge by about a thousand years (though the stone circle itself wasn't set up until around
the same time as Stonehenge).</li>
<li>You can actually walk up to the stones and touch them.</li>
<li>There are sheep grazing all around. Sheep are cute.</li>
<li>In the center of the stone circle is the town of Avebury, complete with a pub. You can enjoy a pint with your henge.</li>
<li>It's cheaper to get to; just take the public bus. It's also free to visit the stones themselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Points in Stonehenge's favor:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way they stack the stones is cool.</li>
<li>It's origins are more mysterious.</li>
<li>There is more signage and tourist infrastructure.</li>
<li>It's one of Those Places. You know, the ones You Just Have To Visit.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the day, I would never tell anyone not to visit Stonehenge. But I would absolutely recommend them to visit
Avebury. There's a small museum right by the stones too, so anyone who feels they are missing out on informational
signage need not worry.</p>
<p>I mean, just look at these happy little guys. How could you resist?</p>
