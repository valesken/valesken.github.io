      <p>Hello and welcome!</p>
<p>Some people have been asking how to follow along as Alexa and I travel around the world. Well, this is it! This blog
is where I'll capture some of our travel stories (and struggles). I'll probably also write a bit about being a software
engineer on the road and my thoughts on writing, because that's part of who I am.</p>
<h2>Now It's Finally Real</h2>
<p>As I write this, I'm on a train winding its way north from Athens, through green fields of sloping farmland and
snow-dusted peaks. This is not the dusty Greece that the &quot;Sword and Sandles&quot; Hollywood movies would have prepared you to
expect. It's lush and beautiful and full of life.</p>
<p>We've been traveling for almost exactly a month now. It's hard to believe. We've driven through the United States,
flown halfway around the world to Israel, and skipped across the sea to Greece. At each point along the way, there have
been many times when we've turned to each other and said &quot;now it finally feels real.&quot; It's become a bit of a gag.</p>
<p>When we booked our first international flight, months ago, it started to feel real. When Alexa quit her job, it felt
real. When we put our last box in storage, locked the door, and drove away it felt real. You get the idea.</p>
<p>Even now, we're still having these moments. In Israel, we were surrounded by friends and friends of friends, we had a
WhatsApp support group of fellow travelers, and we could count on seeing familiar faces most days. When we left that
behind to come to Greece, the trip felt real in a whole new way.</p>
<p>Now that I finally have this blog up and running, let me tell you; it finally feels real.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>I'll post more soon. We've gathered so many stories already and I'm so excited to share them with you here! And as we
head towards the cliff-top monasteries of Meteora (and who knows where after that?), I'm sure there will be many new
stores to come.</p>
<p>See you soon!</p>
