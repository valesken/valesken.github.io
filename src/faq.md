### How Are You Doing This?

We've both been planning for many years to do some sort of long term travel. It was something we even talked about on
our first date! Since then we've been saving up to travel, making a list of destinations, and dreaming. So no, this
isn't something that just happened overnight or on a whim.

Our original plan was to quit our jobs and take off to see the world on May 31, 2020. The world had other plans.

There were some hard conversations... we decided we were too old, the pandemic was never going to end, and maybe it was
time to put down roots. For a year or so, we gave up on the dream.

But you know what? Sometimes you just have to decide that you want something from life and you're gonna make it happen.

### So Did You Quit Your Job?

The short answer is no, I did not quit. I'm still working as we travel. It's a balancing act to be sure, but one I
consider to be worth the effort.

This blog is in no way affiliated with the work I do for my employer, but if you're curious, I work for
[Kiva](http://www.kiva.org) on the Protocol team. Our mission is to remove infrastructural barriers to financial
inclusion using digital technologies. In practice, this means working with governments to provide digital identities to
their citizens. It's super rewarding and I'm really excited to see where the project goes.

### Is This Wordpress?

Nope.

Because I'm a nerd and a software engineer, I decided to take a code-centric way of creating my blog. I'm using
[Github](https://www.github.com) to host a static site generated using [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/). You can find
all the code I've written [here](https://www.github.com/valesken/valesken.github.io).

(Though to be honest, there's not a ton of code involved. It's mostly templates and markdown. Static site generators
are cool.)
