Hello, world. This is the first post of my new travel blog. Let this baby roll!

## Now It's Finally Real

As I write this blog post, I'm on a flight to Tel Aviv. This is the first international portion of the journey and it's
finally feeling real.

## How It Started

To be honest, I can't say when the idea first occurred to me to travel around the world, but I can say that it quickly
took hold as the primary form of my everyday daydream.

When I met Alexa, it was one of the first things we talked about and bonded over. She, too, had long had a dream of
traveling around the world. For her, it was about WWOOFing. For me, it was more abstractly about freedom (though I can't
claim to have a monopoly on that reason for the trip).

## Where It's Going

Who knows?
